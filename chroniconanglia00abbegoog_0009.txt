PREFACE.

Tur. short Cnnouxcnz, published for the fust time iu
this volume, is found in a manuscript preserved in the
British Museum [Com-on, Cleopatra, A, xm], md bem the
name os Hmn 01⁷ Szmmvs aa its author. Nothing
more is known of him; hut we may safely pronon-nee
him to have been one of those numerous mouks, who

employed themselves, during the middle ages, in histo-
rica] and other litenry pursuits. It is probable that he
is the same person who iz mentioned by Eun οι* Tmen-
nmnffl in his Anuals (p. 45). as having been abbat of
Ramsay, and who died iu 12683 iu this cnse the latter
part uf the Chronicle, which extends to 1274, must have
been added by another hand.

The suu-name os silgrave wag, no doubt, taken irem
the place of his birth, which was perhaps Snlgnve in
Northamptoushire ; nt lent 1 ean find no other place
